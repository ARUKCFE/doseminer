\title{Guess dosage unit from prescription text}
\usage{
guess_dose_unit(text)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{character vector of raw prescription text}
}
\value{
a vector of units, the same length as \code{text}. Names are equal to
\code{text}, but I might remove the names later if we decide to use a data
frame-orientated workflow rather than a vector-based one.
}
\description{
Currently works on raw text, but later we might want to demerge this step.
Similarly, the \code{unit_dict} and its reverse-lookup table could be defined
outside this function, both for readability and to avoid redundant computation.

\examples{
presc <- c(
  '1-2 TABLET(S) UP TO FOUR TIMES A DAY WHEN REQUIRED',
  '2 TABLETS FOUR TIMES A DAY',
  '5ML THREE TIMES DAILY WHEN REQUIRED',
  'TAKE 1 FOUR TIMES A DAY WHEN REQUIRED',
  '2 TABLETS FOUR TIMES A DAY WHEN REQUIRED',
  '1 CAPSULE TWICE A DAY',
  '5-10MLS FOUR TIMES A DAY WHEN REQUIRED',
  '2.5 OR 5ML FOUR TIMES A DAY WHEN REQUIRED',
  '10MG WHEN REQUIRED',
  '1 PATCH EVERY 72 HOURS'
)
stack(guess_dose_unit(presc))
